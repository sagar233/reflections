How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It told me lines which were different thus helping me find the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can know about the progress of the file and compare different versions of it for suitable purposes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
manual commit
   pros:
You can crosscheck if the file to be sent is correct.
   cons:
It is tedious. not intuitive to understand
google docs
pros:
saves time
cons:
vulnerable to faulty files
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

   Git helps to serve the purpose of tracking the status of entire project(all the files) whereas google docs are not made with the aim of building projects.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
cd directory	
    git log 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

  You can move to earlier version of the code very easily.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
